Hi, I am Ph.D. candidate at the University of Texas, graduating on August, 2021. My supervisor is Dr. Lina Sela.

Research
========

My research interest is to leverage numerical modeling, algorithm development, remote sensing,
and artificial intelligence to
(1) develop physics-based and data-driven models to achieve high-performance modeling of
water infrastructure systems and enhance the coordination between
interdependent urban infrastructure systems;
(2) improve the operation, control, and management of water infrastructure systems; and,
(3) promote the integration of technical and social components in the development of smart cities.
